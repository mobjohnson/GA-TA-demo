# We're going to add a remote data source to pull in stories from Mashable, Digg, and reddit.
  # http://mashable.com/stories.json
  # http://digg.com/api/news/popular.json
  # http://www.reddit.com/.json
# These stories will also be upvoted based on our rules. No more user input!

# Pull the json, parse it and then make a new story hash out of each story(Title, Category, Upvotes)
# Add each story to an array and display your "Front page"





require 'json'
require 'rest_client'

#class Story
#  attr_accessor :title, :category, :upvotes, :stories
#end

# Yes this is great!!! Maybe instead of an individual class for Story, you could
# have a FrontPage object

#
# initialize???

# You could set up the basic story variables

#
# can then remove empty variables from methods?
#
# what type of class or local variables do I use?
#
stories = []


# You should try converting this to OOP. It will be a good challenge.
